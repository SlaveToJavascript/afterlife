# Afterlife: a one-stop funeral cremation service provider
### Built for IS213 Enterprise Solution Design in 2020.

AfterLife is a funeral-planning eCommerce web application with the objective of being an all-in-one funeral services provider that eliminates the hassle of contacting multiple intermediary service providers to plan funerals.

Customers whose family members have recently passed away can choose from several funeral packages according to the race and religion of the deceased. The packages include everything from venue set-up, coffins, funeral service as well as sending the deceased to the crematorium or cemetery.

On the administrative side, admins can view current orders to find out which undertaker is scheduled, update changes in funerals from customer requests and delete older funeral orders.


In the event of package supplies running low, admin can use the system to re-supply the packages from supplier as well through the system.
